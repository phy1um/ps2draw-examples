# PS2 Draw Examples

This is a PS2 Homebrew project for experimenting with drawing using PS2 hardware. There will be multiple
examples, some utilizing VU1.

This is all built on the work of others.

Special credit goes to:
+ [glampert](glampert.com) - some DMA code borrowed from his PS2 Quake 2 port (which he in turn 
references from someone else)
+ [PS2SDK](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk) - amazing library powering this code
+ [PS2 Scene Discord](https://discord.gg/Ajw2gC) - cool helpful people who have answered my questions

## Why
PS2s are really interesting hardware and there isn't much homebrew for them. The PS2 is also the console I
grew up with, so
making a game to run on one has always been a dream to me. In this repo I want to explore the hardware in a way that lays
a solid framework for more exploration, and give others a solid base for building VU1 renderers. There is so
much I don't understand with PS2s so I encourage all feedback and PRs. Find me in the discord linked above
to discuss ideas.
